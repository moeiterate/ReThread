Mountain time commitment. And making sure I leave enough budget in case they're like, Oh, we really need you. Like, come through this one project, like, the last one I did, but I'm, uh... So that's why I was like, Adam... And of course, all the AIs are, like, giving me super conflicting information. I was like, I don't know, like, one of them is telling you to, like, reserve most of the budget for projects. Everyone's telling you, like, no, reserve it for, which, like, I don't know. Yeah, I guess. I was... uh, when I was planning, 'cause the last couple days, I've just been planning my... exit to figure out, man, what the fuck am I actually gonna do? Yeah, so how you're handling that? Bro, it's kind of, it's really stressful. So my plan is, I'm going to request PFML. What's that? Which is, uh, basically... I actually don't know what the acronym says means, but it's basically, like, hate time off with medical leave from the Washington government. Apparently, in the state of Washington, they have to give you, like, two grand every couple of weeks, and you can just say you have a mental health issue. Where that's in addition to your, uh, self? No, no, I think it's separate from the salad. There's another thing you could do called, uh, STD, which doesn't mean that it's... It's a sick time off or sick, whatever. Uh, which is basically the same requirements. It just longer than Microsoft has to pay you. Like up to 20 weeks or something, a salary? Fool? Which is crazy. Wait, is that technically considered as, like, a beautiful deep? Yeah, basically. So I think I did something like that when I left Clipod. But, uh, because I lived in Arizona, I didn't qualify from California, which I think would have actually had me paying my salary, so that's not... Yeah. It's not weird like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Instead, Arizona was more so like, okay, you can stay on your health insurance. Right? You're not getting Payton. Yeah, which is fine. I mean, I'm fucking over that place, both. Uh... But I have a virtual session book, a primary tomorrow. Primary? No, no, no, no. My primary doctor. Oh, no, no, no. It was pretty cool. It's been really nice. He was in the office, Palestinian dude. I mean, I was been like a once or twice, I've gone to see them, and we were just talked about delicious. Oh yeah, let's do some blood work. So I'm hoping to be like, hey man, here's my situation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you give me kids? Can you like, like, I'm not trying to like compromise, but you hook me up. He says no, he's a loss, bro. I just put in my 2 meats. Um, well, you could probably do, though, to actually see a, like, a therapist. I do. I go on for two weeks, so he owes me a letter tonight. Uh, I've been seeing... Because, like, at the time my grandfather had passed, that was part of the reason why I was, like, I can't bankrupt any time, ever. So they actually let me use that therapist space and just, like, wrote a thing and said, you know, there's a deal. Thank you. They were like, okay, sure. Yeah, no, I go there. I actually here in Tucson, I went to a... And he's been suggesting I do this for a while because I've been like so depressed with his jobs. So he's like, yeah, I'll write the letter. I'll get it to you by tomorrow. So that's the plan, take the letter to Nawaf. Hopefully, the wife signs the letter, take the Microsoft, tell the fuck off. It was so, it was still gratifying us, guys. We're pushing this French clown. And I've been complaining about, so they made, they gave me vulnerability burned down if it cut out. So the cloud had 1.1 million vulnerabilities on children. Wait, what does that mean? Meaning old OS's on different devices, things that would, what, art internal tool triggers as a red flag for a bad actor to be the an axis? So my program... brought us down from $1.1 million to $220,000, which is 7 times decrease in vulnerabilities. That entire time, this dude named Moore, was saying that my idea was bullshit. Getting calls with leaders, we'd argue on the call. Uh, go back and forth about how I went about things the wrong way and... He manages the vulnerability management team. Since my team wasn't, I guess, friends with the vulnerability management team, they gave me one day to submit 200 incidents. We had to split it amongst five employees. We worked all night just to submit a system filling in a form and it notifies the team, hey, you fucked up, depending on the severity. Notifies their team. Their team. So he was basically just trying to put bureaucracy in front of him. Yeah, yeah. was like, hey, this was a bad idea. I wouldn't have done that. I was like my VP told me I had to do it in 24 hours. I didn't have time to check with you. First all, I didn't know who you were, right? So we'd argue, go back and forth, he'd shit on me in front of leaders. Hate this dude. Last week, it's announced Mortz brought into, as a new manager, and since I'm the vulnerability management PM, they moved me under more. Oh, that's your new boss. Yeah. Fuck that. And then we get on a call, and he's like, Hey, I know we had our differences, but I think I do respect your work and you did a really good job with the program. I was like, bro, you were shitting, you were shitting on me in front of everyone that needed to know I was doing a good job with the program, and they all thought it was a bad program. And then he goes in this whole drill circuit thing about how he needs to be number one. At that point, I already hated it and I was like, I'm not, I'm not fucking dealing with this thing. I'm not gonna do it. There's no way. And then today, so the reason I gave you that background, we are running a model where we have to transition the cloud over France. So we don't manage the climate. We build the cloud, we do a cutoff, they take the cloud. They moved a bunch of the services into the cloud, because that's just naturally what happens with buildout, you build it in the public cloud, you transition it in private. And then since the OS is in private, we're older than the ones in public, all those vulnerabilities came back. So all my work were banished. And not only that, everyone started reaching out and said, hey, the audit that they're doing on the cloud actually doesn't, they don't even touch the public cloud. They only touch in cloud. So basically, all the work that I did for the last 4 months, complete fucking waste of time. Well, those vulnerabilities are still there. Still there and they're brand new and it's like, I did no work. I found that out yesterday. Regularly, I would have flipped out. Probably would have went in a panic, but I was like, I fucking quitted. I'm just like, I'm fucking done, dude. Honestly, sometimes it's the most healthy thing you can do for yourself. Yeah, I mean, it's, like, I had nothing lined up after I left hip pod, and I was like, I just can't stay... What? Was it not scary, dude? I mean, I don't know. I mean, now I haven't worked for anybody else for what, three, four years here? I don't know, like, it's been perfectly fun. Like, obviously, I mean, it's not as comfortable. It's not as, like, yeah, fuck it, whatever. I have money coming in next month, tighten the belt a little bit, but like... Things still rug kept rolling. I mean, how did that, like, just pull us my thought, provided where it needed when it was needed. The kid came along, brought Sarah on to us, were there? So that was good, 'cause otherwise, then I would have been in trouble. But... And now you're gonna be on retainer Japan Airlines. That's okay. Phil, I mean, it's... No, so heavy for you. Remember, remember fucking trying to figure out how to use, like, softer and shit like that? So I think that's, you know, what's interesting about it, too, is like, I mean, it's very clear to me, like, and it has always been, ever since, you know, all over the nice stuff. So, actually, I mean, even before, they, I accept all the no current world things, but, like, I'm like, you don't... There's a massive shift comfort. Like, we talked about it for years ago. Yeah. And this is actually, I think, probably ever since the whole Claude piece really took off. I don't know, I've seen the headlines, or, like, a lot of tech, SAS products are starting to take a shift. Yes. Finally, the shift that we were talking about four years ago is finally starting to happen. when Big Tech was starting to eat, and some shit, starting to get worried, because now we can create whatever the hell they want. So... And so, I mean, the way I see it now is, like, now that it's starting to get a little bit more normalized, like, more people are, like, open to the idea of, like, Hey, yeah, fine, AI here, okay? Um, I do believe there's the ability to basically be, like, Hey, small businesses, you guys know how you've been, like, at the mercy of tech, you're, like, you're hawk breaking your business the way your software vendor sports you. We can help you take back control. Yeah. Like, you don't need to deal with whatever piece of shit software you're doing with. You can get your own solution, you can own it. You're not paying subscription fees. You are not, like, sticking around with this young guy, and, yeah, whatever. That's talks about... Basically, just being able to give small business in the beginning, to have the same, like, power as the big tech. Like if you think about it, like, between you and I, right? Like, we have worked in tech for many years. We're very familiar with, like, what's happening under the... Not lying, so, like, say, like, we're literally bringing the same strategies and the same, like, algorithmic approaches. as big text. Yeah. Um, so for small businesses, I mean, imagine, like, managing inventory, the same way that, like, Walmart basically does. It's really, like, if we think about it, like, a lot of these, a lot of, like, just big companies compared up with that woman. Well, I'm having some kind of software to give him the edge. It's the same software that can be written down. Yeah. Extra same, like, it's the same, you know, like, calculation, same algorithm, same everything. The only difference is what. Like, they just have 25 engineers doing the same thing over and over to make sure it works. Yeah. For a small business. Yeah. They don't need that shit. No. Okay. So... It sounds awesome. I just... But the thing is, like, from the small business side, though, that's the part that I've struggled for the last 4 years, really trying to sit up to. Yeah. I mean, the, the, the, the, and thing legends were love. Like, and then, like, it happened, but I'm hoping, like, that then can be used to, like, basically keep bouncing out and shit more enterprise fights, because, like, that's... keeps the lights on, and keep things on. But I'm hoping, like, a small business piece, though, is, like, especially after your tone for your friend, I was, like, just charging, like, two grand to this pharmacy. Yeah. So dope spot to be in. Yeah. Imagine having, like, 10 of those. Yeah. That'd be sick. Yeah, I was, uh, playing around thinking through how we could do it. Um, and I think there could be... So, what I did for my dad's business, when I needed to, when I built out route of, and then I realized, the NEMT, the ghost that they gave me, was complete bullshit, like, the PDF, that they have all the providers, like, 30% of them were just, were not even real companies. What? It was insane, even though they updated it, like, last week, like, some of them were just, like, completely transitioned to taxi services and weren't doing access anymore. It was weird. Some of them just like didn't exist. Um, so, basically just used cursor and claw to do a scraper to basically validate, which... companies were legitimate, scraped the phone number, the email address, and I'm like, if we're trying to find those SMB businesses that don't have particular software, they could quickly hit a 8 on ingredient. You could apply this in a logic, right? I don't know, I didn't call... E mail lums? Both? I think some of it, like, I think, really, like, I don't know, I kind of transitioned away from the idea of, like, let's just mass hit everybody. And move more towards, like, let's find specific targets, and that's, like, you know, obviously, they don't put all your eggs in one basket, but, like, let's make that one target feel like, holy shit, like, these guys really understand my business. They really know who I am. Like, it's kind of like what I do in Japan era. It's kind of leading up to this point, which was, like, anytime, like, I would talk to them, and it would, like, just still having discussion with new contracts, nothing. Um, like, for example, last, going into this, to this last project, I basically gave the VP of, like, Here's mock ups of, like, three or four different things that are, like, they were plain, too. It was like their existing site, but I literally redid it. I was like, Imagine if you actually took the time to redo this and, like, pay attention to what you used. They are asking you their ears to it, and there's a mockup, that's what it would look like. I mean, it's not at all what she was asking for, but it was enough of an impression to be like, Holy shit, that's our website. That's our name. But it looks way better. Yeah. Um, and so we got her attention, and, you know, in the conversation. Yeah. kind of the same deal, I think, with this. And, I mean, not to get to a far off topic, but, like, with new stickers, for example, on the spot. By the way, you're dope. I have them on my water body, but yeah, they're really well done. Um, but she, so she created a sticker pack through a coffee shop down the, oh, the... espresso or something? Yeah, it's called espresso. So she created a sticker pack for them. Yeah, that she sold to them proportionally and whatnot. But she customized it to them. But, like, it's literally just like their logo, like, holding out with some of the stickers. And then, you know, everything else is kind of generic coffee, but, like, the point I'm making with that is that, like, to them it was so special because it had their name on it versus her going in and being like, I have, you know, I have stickers with coffees on it. Can you guys sell it? your shop? Instead, like, this is your sticker. And so, like, they were really excited about so much, so, like, it actually sold out by, I think, by the end of the week or something. They have, because they have really, this is like kind of another piece as well, but like their, their brands are like, their community is very strong, they're, The point I'm making with it is like being able to, like, go directly to a small business, kind of like what your friend was doing as well. Like, if we see you didn't have a website, so, like, until you went RAF. Yep. And showing, like, this is yours. Like, this is your name, your... Yeah. I think it leaves a much stronger impression as opposed to, like, Hey, you want to talk to me? Mm hmm. So, I submitted this. So, what I've been trying to do is seeing, like, if what I actually can do has any value to anyone outside of my dad. So what I've been doing is just going on up work and submitting proposals for just a bunch of random shit. So this is one for D&D lots. It, a law firm in Atlanta. And they had someone they needed for like 30 hours at $40 an hour or something. Um, so basically, I built a script that I provide the description of the upwork, uh, and then it uses that plus what I went into the profile, found a different claim of some Indian dude, not to be racist, that built them their original website, and then he used it to put it on his profile. So he took his website, exported it, and I said, yo, put a bunch of screenshots and cursor, and said, create the dash that he's looking for from the upwork. And then I submitted my proposal. Guy didn't fucking open the proposal, I'll be honest. Basically, what he was looking was for a way for his internal clients, attorneys, et cetera, et cetera, to create documents. Like, send this to him? I sent it to him. Yeah. So he enters the information, he generates the document, then it's supposed to hit DocuSign's API. They signed the lease, boom, and then the signature's done. Right. That's what I said. I was like, hey, this is what it could be. Right? At the end, it says higher developer, it's supposed to go to my upward profile. The guy didn't open the fucking, you didn't open the proposal. But that sounds exactly what you're kind of saying, right? It's like 100%. Yeah, just like literally click through demos. Yes. Yeah. So when you said that, yeah. Because, I mean, like in the and because what did you build that one on? Uh, Cursor, but Gemini 3, bro, it's legit. Gemini? Like, what stock did he eat? React, uh, type script. Okay, so like that's like that's that's like an actual like functioning thing. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, it doesn't actually, it's just, I said, I basically did this. I gave him the, I gave cursor the file, uh, route that I used for Rudo for that same demo and said you were just, just create basically net for this. Yeah, so I didn't really, honestly, it was maybe 3 or 4 prompts. I was like, here's the repo of the existing demo. I basically want this, but with these requirements for this particular website, you just did it. Dude, that's brilliant. You think so? I mean, it's it's literally like a functioning thing. Yeah, yeah, obviously, to them, they won't know that it's like, okay, there's no backend, whatever it is, but like, hooking up it back into that would literally just be like using the super-based MCPs, telling Clayton, okay, let's run it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's fucking genius. Yeah, to your point. just sending people, like, or just walking in and being like, look at this. Is this something you guys need, technically? I kind of did that at a cop, another cop shop, uh, called Bruce Station down on, uh, uh, Broadway in Walmart or something? Yeah. Because New and I went there, we were working out of there for a little while, not so finally one time I was like, this guys don't even have a website. So, like, I literally, it didn't end up going on her, but, um, as I was sitting there doing my other work, I asked it, like, to, like, basically, like, fit all the images into logos and everything, and then finally, like, it, it made some pretty cool stuff here and there. And then I walked up to the guy and I was like, hey, I do this. I was just messing around and I made this. Like, if you want it, you can have it. Like I don't, I'm not looking to charge you, but if I can be of assistance, let me know. He took my phone number, but he never called me, never called. I mean, that's also on me. I never bought the phone up. But I think stuff like that is like, it's a perfect segue into, you know, let's have a conversation. Yeah. Figure out what we can help you out and, like, make some money basically. But I think what's nice about, like, all of this, though, too, is that, like, because of business, it's, like, it's B to B stuff, we can actually quantify it and say, just, you know, I'm sure your friend did the same thing with the pharmacy. I'm gonna charge you 2 grand because I'm gonna make you 10 grand. Yeah, whatever it is. So a lot of this stuff, definitely having the numbers, I think, would be a big part of going and having those conversations. Yeah, for sure. Do you have any idea of, like, the answer doesn't have to. I agree that I think mass engaging people's probably just own move, but like what vertical do we start with? That was the other thing I was gonna, I was curious your thoughts on, but I don't know what the right vertical is, but I definitely think like the verticals that we can find, especially like things that are recurring, any kind of subscription-based stuff or any kind like gyms, for example, is a big one or anything, any member stuff like that. For some reason, that's been very attractive to me, mate, because I'm also coming from, you know, the PDC side where it was all subscription based. But being able to leverage a lot of that knowledge and like the way we handled data on that side of things into these kind of settings, I think you make a big difference. In terms of like, okay, it's fine. You know, you have subscriptions, you're going to have memberships or whatever it is, but like, do you actually understand what your members want? You actually understand like how to maximize the value of your own members over time. Yeah. And then, so it touches on both the strategy side, but and data, but also then it becomes like, okay, now that we understand, like, the, you know, the metrics or the value, you know, the value of your customer, here's what we can build to help you make that experience better. or here's what we can build to, you know, whatever, whatever specific things they want. But then also kind of like we were talking about the other day of like, how many of these gyms are probably on mind, body, or on any of these and like they're paying subscriptions to have every single month, and they're unlimited, or like they're, they're bound to whatever things actually come, and it's how you have to operate a bit. Um, basically being able to go in there and say, like, here's an alternative. That's yours. You own it? We're happy to give you, like, service if you need it afterwards, but... That's it? No more, no more subcriptions. And in those cases, I think a lot of times it becomes easier to be like, we're literally going, Yeah, we're going to charge you 5 grand, whatever it is up front. But then you're never paying the subscription, right? Right. The only thing that I still haven't quite tried, like, figured out is like when it comes to actually deploying it, the cost of doing so. especially if it becomes something like that's just eating up a lot of resources, but that's a problem for another day. Yeah, just my dad has 80 trips, a, I think, after 2 weeks at this point. Just maintaining the HIPAA compliant act like Azure is custom in ages. 75, 80 bucks a month? Damn. Which is a lot. It's like... what he needs. because there's every... There's like none of the apps had when you sort of HIPOComplonent platform, and the only one that has a reasonable cost is Azure. And that just sucks to the point, people have actually done it outside. It's like, I've done it for work, but doing it now, someone is such a... such a fucking waste of time. Like, it doesn't have intuitive at all. And they have so many things that could be combined in a one app that they've split into 50 different services. So they can upcharge each use. Yeah. Notice that's what Azure does. They didn't even give you like free, free address services, an employee? For 2 months, I was free, but I didn't want to... I was scared of the legality in case it was any good, then maybe someone said, cause you didn't make IP or some shit. I'm used to critics. Yeah. So, what is this? So yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's a way we can cut down the costs. I mean, I definitely think staying away from things like hippo-compliance is like... Yeah, I could tell. But I'm saying... ahead. I was going to say fitness stuff, apparently, I think that might end that there's some something new around like... So I don't know where that goes, but we could stay away from it, but I also think a lot of people are just because they don't, you know, the risk, but so maybe that could be a potential lane. Like, I don't know if this this legal thing is... So, basically, my appetus flips, so it's creating the document 1st and then you're scanning it and printing it. My dad's was just scanning the document, pulling the data. Like, that seems to be the fact that that guy was asking to hire somebody for that. Maybe it's something I, I don't know how you look about custom documents or whatever, but even a law firm that needs to create a quick retainer document or something. I mean, could be something. But yeah. Gyms could be the move. I just don't know much about, like, what their back end. Uh, like what their operation process is. I mean, I don't know, I'm sure we're gonna run into that with pretty much any business. Although I will say transportation, for whatever reason, I mean, you and I both obviously have that in common with our dads. Um, and with my dad. So actually, now that I'm thinking about it, he may already be able to have an in one transportation business, so it wouldn't, and it was just straight, it was my dad's old company mom. The one he sold in Phoenix? Okay. Because my cousin is the one that's actually running it. My cousin... How about I say this nicely? He's not the brightest guy ever. Oh, really? Um, but essentially it was like 2 Indian guys that bought the company for my dad and then they're like, we don't have time to run this shit. So they basically promoted my cousin from... Head mechanic? So, literally, now he's, like, running the place? Um... So, something like that, I think, would not, because, 1st of all, I already know all the software they're eating. They're using a piece of shithold system that's, like... There, you have to remote into a computer, somewhere in their clear voice. So you're literally opening windows, you're opening remote desktop. The remote desktopping into this, one of their servers, we're not all shits, they can then access this software that looks like it's still stuck in 1995. Wow. It operates like garbage. I mean, well, I take it back. It operates well for their purpose. Like it's consistent. But, I mean, if you look at this thing, you're like, what the fuck? How is anybody in 2026 still using this? Um, Probably a lot of the same, like, logistical problems when you're sure your dad chased. Um, But, I mean, from like an app building perspective, it would literally probably just be like making sure that we have a very clear set of requirements, making sure very clear screens on like what every piece is. But replicating what they have would not be that hard. That said, there are like more in-depth stuff around like different types of trips and shit like that. depending on the situation. But, um, anyways, the point I'm going with it is like this software is a piece of shit. And like at one point during, um, what is it? I think it was like early COVID, they literally just, they, they, something got access, whatever it is, and like they were just like, sorry, nobody can access their accounts. And every business that was like their customer is literally like at a standstill. How the hell am I supposed to operate my business? They literally gave no nothing, nothing. Um, to the extent that my dad, like, I had to fill him, like, I had to work with some guy and up work at the time, like, write a script to, like, move stuff around in bull sheets, and they were operating out of Google Sheets. That was it. This, like, 50 person, 50 van. I remember how many people they had at the time and like, I don't know how many 100s of trips per day. are now operating out of Google Sheets. Um, so yeah, this software is a piece of absolute piece of shit, and if I remember correctly, it should not be that hard to actually find that their entire client list because of the way that they actually plant their URLs. Um, where, I don't, I don't remember the details, but essentially, like, I believe we should be able to, basically, if we wanted to build a scraper to, like, go find me every, every year all that starts with this thing and, like, has the shit in it? And it would find the booking site for every company that's using this software complex. Um, so we basically have a client list at that point, we could pretend to lead this, who we do reach out to. But, um, I don't know. I mean, that's another... sounds like it's a quick doubt. That said, working with my cousin could be a whole, I haven't talked to the guy in a while, but like, it's business. Yeah, okay. Why not? I mean, I'm I still want to get something out of the transportation ingles that's expensive. Damn near. Probably, like, 5 months worth of working. that no one's using? That's how I feel about Pirkos. I'm just like, what the fuck? Yeah, yeah. Oh, that and, you know, room shuttle down the street used to be Arizona shuttle? No. You're in the shuttle service that goes between two signings. So they're actually pretty big, groom as a company. So it used to be Arizona shuttle. and my dad and his partners owned it. She's like up until 2001. Something like that when 911 happened. They sold it to some other guy locally. This guy then sold it to this company called Groom, and these, this company Groom has, uh, has, has transportation business around the whole country. So that's a huge company. But they bought this and then they ended up buying a bunch of stuff in Phoenix, something Prescott, something in Sedona, I think Flagstaff. So like they literally go all up and down through sun and they're also using Hudson. What the fuck's Hudson? I mean, if you look it up, it's like, it's literally just the shittiest software. Did he, um, give you a Wi-Fi password? Uh, yes, but I already forgot. I'll ask you my phone. Ah, I don't know what to do. It's on the right data. I really care. I'll ask you something. Is fast? All right. It's okay. think? Yeah, look, look, look... The cobbler sucks the first case cabin. Is it doing anything for you, the comeston? No. Like, my telling my friend... Yeah, my tongue went numb, too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude. You know they have one of those... Like the one on Tanka Verde? It's like a, it's like a weed smoking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude. These guys. Wow, they definitely up their website, but their software does not look anything like this. I'll see what I might do, actually. No, they even have any screen. They're stupid if they have screenshots, because they're so not... They're not... This is their mind, well, this is the exact same knowledge base that they had 10 years ago. I mean, if this is any indication, this is pretty much, like, Rex is, like... But the point is, like, it forced my dad into having to run his business in a way that he was, like, dude, what the fuck? This is not how we want to run our shit. So it's Hudson's software for technical support, or is it Hudson? Yeah. Software. Ground transportation. So I think they ended up getting bought by some company in Canada. You said in Kenya? Canada. It's like, damn, dude, shout out to Kenya. Yeah, but if I look up Hudson, ground software, ground transportation. Yeah, yeah, it's here, but there's, uh, the top link was, uh, Chetu. I think that's sponsored. Interesting. The point is, where I'm bringing this up, is, like, I think there could be an opportunity to be, like, you know, to go into a company like Arizona Shuttle, or, like, my cousin or them and my cousin. Um, and be like, Hey, you mean, you know how you're dealing with that bullshit stuff? Yeah. But you happy that? I can't even find any screenshots anymore. Because this isn't the only one. you've seen it, too, with your dad, but, like, I mean, just finding decent transportation software is a nightmare? It's terrible, dude. In voicing receivables, payment track. Yeah. Oh, here we go. This was 12 years ago, and I'm pretty sure has not changed at all. So, like, when I say you were moving in, literally remoting in, whatever. This is this is it. This is the software. That shit pisses me out. Like, this is literally what you're expected to operate your business. Oh, for example, like just to be able to change your prices, you could not do it on your own. First of all, it was like way too technical. No, no small business ever going to figure out because you had to like, import a CSV and had to be in their exact format, but it was very confusing. Extremely confusing. There was no assistance, no, nothing. I mean, they had technical support, but they were a nightmare to deal with. Anyways, I mean, here's... example, the bush of software. Uh, so you can find. Eventually, they added, like, or you can track your vehicle and type of stuff, but, like, And we'll see it's... This is insane, dude, though. There it is. And what is it showing? Right now, I believe this might be the dispatch game. I don't even know how... So, like, this is, I think, an example of something, like, going in there, going into a business and saying, you know how you're dealing with that shit, and the battle. Yeah, and I think it's pertinent, and maybe what I've learned, you probably have too, is that like, I have the client before you build the full solution. No, absolutely. But the thing is, like, with something as simple as that, like even having a baseline, using, for example, like what you did. Because at the end of the day, it's just literally like a superbased table with, like, what, the right, the right column and stuff. Yeah. Um, and even if it's just a mock... Yeah. Like, how you did with the lawyer one, I mean, nobody has to know that this is not right in the background. Yeah, they don't. Um, that's cool. Yeah, bro, I'm down. I mean, that took me just a couple prompts, I think, if you build, if we have a subset of clients that we want to tackle, split time, just kind of building the MVPs, and then, I think the part that I would be more, most nervous about is just, like, engagement and how do we actually get them to see us as legitimate, as opposed to just 2 guys trying to fuck them over or something. Which seems to be the case every time I try to call somebody. So I think maybe that's when we like, okay, good shot to things like the, teaching the commerce, like, not spoil, or, like, starting to sun, just be, like, starting this up. Yeah, I'd love to, like, keep some free, something free or whatever. It's something that gives people what's in there. Yeah. Um, and, like, so you can get any bites there. Yeah. But I think reality is, like, we're just gonna have to get them completely. Yeah. Which is fine. I hate doing that shit. I don't the fuck is the fuck? I don't know. But to your point about the upward stuff, I think that's another interesting one too, because I, like, I mean, I knew you could, like, like, bid on a project, but, like, don't touch it, but, like, I didn't really realize, like, how streamline I could make it. Yeah, because you have to pay for connects. So that's how you avoid scammers and a bunch of false. Um, and with most projects, they'll usually have 5 to 10 proposals within the 1st hour. And I was looking on Reddit and they're like, you want to be one of the 1st 5 proposals to even get viewed? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So out of the 7 that I submitted before they locked me out and asked me to verify my identity. 2 of them got viewed, but none of them got selected. Frankly, I was using AI to write everyone and they're like, M dashes, and I was referencing a portfolio markdown, and I could look back at the proposals, like, I wouldn't fucking. I don't even know what, I don't even know what I'm saying. Like, I don't even know what I'm reading. I was like, you should probably just like handwrite these and be a little bit more personable, dude, but I, you know, I'm actually finding myself in the position now where, like, especially after this last project, I'm like, I, I shouldn't move through the library on Sunday. Yeah. I spent way more hours literally just trying to cut out what I graded most of the time. Yeah. It's just great content that it's like, yeah, that's nice in theory of whatever the hell theory you're losing. Yeah, yeah. It doesn't work here. But it doesn't work in actual practice, yeah. So I think that is another route that, like, would be worth exploring, especially Michaela, because we could just, like, optimize the hell out of the process. Yeah. Let's focus on these vertical, if you're saying, then just create, like, whatever everything it might be for them that they're asking for. Yeah. Um... I mean, you're running it out. Yeah, dude, I mean, the verticals I wrote down, I'm trying to remember what I was. by the way, I don't think it should just be like people that are asking for software. Like, even on the other side of some of the services that are offered off work, like, it was research. Yeah. Um, like UX recently. So, something I want to build, and I know it's definitely possible, because I found all the pieces at this point, of, like, essentially, imagine the AI basically running your product development for you, in the sense of, like, running research for you, actually serving video people, building, you know, building the surveys, whatever it is that you need. Um, and then, right, basically, giving back the analysis of the results, and then, from there, building the demo, or whatever, you can lock up the prototype, whatever it is. Uh, interesting. Because, so I was checking out, um, there's something called prolific. And prolific essentially allowed you to survey people, and you pay, like, you know, depending on how much, how many responses went up, um, it can be, like, 50 cents a response or something like that. And then you can, I mean, you can basically link them to whatever you want to send them to. They have certain rules that, like, you're not allowed to, like, solicit them into your business. Yeah. But the reason why it's gotten so intriguing to me is because, like, instead of, say, like, paying serving would be, or, like, maids, or some of these others, to, like, run your, you know, run, like, your prototypes, and have people responsive, and they literally just do it ourselves, though. So essentially, you tap this prolific API, and basically, into, you know, into the, into that cursor room, whatever you would be able to herb between, and have the AI basically interact with, to build the ability to build your survey on their end, find the participants, to they allow you to do that, basically, if you have, like, I want people in the United States, who are real estate agents, who are this, this, survey them. And, I mean, there's kind of a random video, there's such pretty sick. Um, it gets back... It creates a survey, sends it to this group of people, and then it's analyzing, and my husband there, and you're basically just going on. Um, and so prolific is what they're selling the ability to actually engage people within the sample size that you want. Pre much, yeah. And how do they find people to do the studies? Um, I mean, I think a lot of times, like, people actually sign up, like, there's another thing called, um, it used to be called usability, how I think it was. Yeah Um, and so I signed up, like, 10, 15 years ago, to be somebody that would love to take surveys, and, like, you could be, like, a double urgent person. So, like, over the years, I think after 20 years, I think, since college or something like that. I started doing I made like 100 points. Thanks. That's not terrible. What? For other companies, it's great feedback. It's great, it's great. So, in terms of, like, upwork working too well, I think, like, professional services, I think we can very much consider ourselves beyond just, like, game software. Yeah, like, we could do the strategy side, we could do the research side. And I know, for a fact, there's definitely, like, startups on there that are a little bits, 'cause, like, you know, the pit pot, we hired, there are, actually, like, two or three different researchers off... because, I mean, you didn't know what they were doing. They just had the money to burn, basically. Yeah. But I think, to your point, having that upward piece could be a very nice, like, pipeline where we start trying to build out and see, like, someone just getting bites. Yeah. Um, because it's remote, it's really nice, too. Yeah, exactly. That makes the operational piece of at ease in your 100%, you know. I down, man. That's a really good idea. I didn't know you even, uh, survey APIs. No, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know it's possible because prolific has an API that allows you to basically do everything you can do in the UI. And then, actually, I think I have to... I actually had, I had clawed basically build me out, like, the survey that I wanted to run. Uh huh. And so instead of using something like, um, like, like, the prolifics will build a survey. Mm hmm. I just created my own. And so it allowed me to essentially customize whatever I want. I didn't go, like, I didn't do anything special with it, but, for the next second, like... You know, a lot of times, like, I'm using type form or something, like, you have to, like, pay for, like, features, like, branching or something stupid, like that. You like, I'm not gonna pay you $100 a month just so I could do that. Like, this is a very simple survey. But, like, it took up to Superbase, so all the data was getting dumped in there. Mm hmm. It has all kinds of different branching and stuff like that, branching logic, depending on what the first answers, like, I mean, you look around, and they're just like, Nothing special, in a sense. But imagine if instead now, all of a sudden, it's like, I really want people to also take, you know, this usability test. for a mock up that we're filming. So now we can also just throw that on there. Dude, that would be that would be so so neat. It's such a particular needed niche specifically for startups. Like if you could integrate the mockups into the tests and then validate with actual in industry folks. That's the thing is, like, it would not be hard to do at all. Here's what else. So, like, the clear cuts of stuff, for example, Like, this is this is literally just an HTML page. There's all kids about how buying, how compared to, but like, I'm just using it to build my mockup, so. Yeah. So, like, it would not be that hard to include this as part of that survey and say, like, okay, go ahead and click around, get feedback, whatever it is we want, right? But for a startup. This could literally just be, like, us recreating their product or, like, their internal thing, whatever it is that they're trying to build. Um, and being able to offer it to them is, like, we can give you most ability to listen for you. Mm hmm. That's real to do. That's kind of a genius idea. And it could even be on a per feature level. 'Cause I remember doing that, Microsoft, I worked on a product team, 6 months, and I got laid off, but something that I realized that they really, like, bro, we would spend very expensive hours and hours just arguing about, like, one box on the admin center. about like the way it should be portrayed or like whether or not like the graph should go above this. And it's just like, what we really needed was customer feedback, but we had no customers. And that was at, like, a Microsoft one. And no one was using the admin center. We were all just pretending like we knew what we were doing. So, like, to be able to even, like, oh shit, I need immediate feedback on this feature. Upward proposal, prolific API, demo, they click through, and then we're saying, hey, we're able to get you 50 pieces of feedback, let's say, my thing, 2 weeks. By the way, it's actually, like, human dinner to get, like, for, like, eight surveys that I ran, I probably hadn't even done more than, like, a couple hours, you know. And, I mean, they were very simple, but, I mean, you're talking about, basically, you know, what to reduce. Granted, I mean, there's something to be said about, like, the proper research methods, and nothing about what you're doing. Yeah, it makes sense. Like, let's say in that scenario, you could have gone to, like, anything, that's an enterprise contract, you could charge, like, $25,000, and be different from the right survey for you, and tell your team, and, This is where you hit with that thing. Floyd. Well, grand for, like, a week... Yeah. I liked every idea that we've had so far. I like that one a lot, just because to your point, and what you said even at the, uh, bonfire is true. And frankly, the amount we were playing our UX researchers at Microsoft was insane, but like, Everyone's building something right now, but no one really knows what to do. And if and if you can automate aspects of customer engagement validation, That's huge, especially in this market where, again, everyone's building everything. Which, by the way, I do want to make sure that, like, we're not just, like, constantly trying to, like, cram down to, like, the list chase down businesses. Like, we should definitely build random full of shit. Oh, yeah, 100%, my thing. Oh, yeah, sure. Just because, like, I think a lot of times, kind of going back to the open source piece, like, something like that, but definitely open doors for us to be like, You know, we built, and we're minimal, but we want to specify the 40, let us know. Um, yeah. That said, maybe I'm too much of a chemist. Because I think the reality is that, like, most things are gonna, like you said, everyone's building something and both things are gonna get jokes. But is it built for me? You know, Sanjay Square? Like, as a business, is this thing built for me? No, well, then, you know, I'll just find the guy that will build it for me, 'cause the reality is we live in a world now where somebody comes to do that. Yeah. Um, that, and I genuinely believe that, like, the reality, the future is, like, no one's gonna pay for software in that way anymore. Why would I bother? Like, I'm never gonna buy a fitness subscription again. Yeah. Now that I figured out how to do this stuff in there, I was like, No, I'm not. Even Fitbot. I not paying these assholes $10 a month. Oh. Um... Yeah, once I leave Microsoft, what's something I can do on the side? Show progress. And I was like, what if every time, everything in my life, I have custom made actful except something. Even Instagram, or, like, reminders. Now, probably budget. Like, if I just created everything myself, I just thought it wasn't. That's kind of where I've gone for the last year now, especially since I started seeing, what's it called? PDS, or a co-pilot. Because it's, like, it's easier for me to do that and get exactly what I want. then to, like, I don't know, let's say I need, like, a note taking thing, but I'll get, like, ever note or one of these other things. It's like, I'm not gonna pay you. Yeah, and a lot of times, I'm finding, at least for myself, I'm finding I'm working locally a lot of times in these, most of the time. I've never deploying these. Yeah. But, like, I did the job, so why do I need to? No, it works. Yeah, I'd like to, you know, figure out how the open source to customization type items. I think it's just, what, like, a portfolio site, like we said with folks. I know, pretty much. I mean, imagine for transportation, it might be like, Hey, we, you know, we have this open source. We have the surface shop where we built for small business transits. Well, can fish beans, and stuff. And, you know, I'd like us to customize the forces. We love to move toward. Just check it out, see how to use it yourself. Yeah. Um, I think I minimum it, like, opens the door to, like, have a conversation. Even if they don't buy, at least, like I said, like, you know, somebody else that quit Jesus. Again, it's free. This can use yourself. Yeah. Or we can make it your own. I don't know how well it's gonna work, but I don't know, I mean, I think we're moving towards that world. Yeah, I think at the very least now. I don't know, to be able to build things that at least someone uses, like the one I haven't gotten past. It's just, like, actually... having legitimate users of any sort, some treats of open sourcing it. That'll be interesting, but I wonder if the quality of the code will be scrutinized. Yeah. If Apple wants taxes... I mean, if anything, there might even be better for us, then, because it's like, Okay, well, if somebody's taking the time to scrutinize it, then that means you're interested. So, anyway, we're open sourcing it because, you know, we want to make it available, and we just love to help us out, sure. Doesn't mean we're not gonna, doesn't mean we're gonna pay you. But... it makes our software better. Yes. Uh, so let's do it. That part's clean. I'm still... I really think, and maybe this is just fun. Even right now, this team that I'm leaving, we're building up some dog shifts off group. Detections and vulnerability blended. Like, I think to your point, it's such a massive mob, like, just feedback from the actual attitude. You could marry the scraping engagement with the actual demos, like the solution. It's like, Hey, just provide us the code. We'll earn the... we'll handle the creation of the... we, uh, serving area. I send it out to the people that made the feedback on. Well, you know, even some incentivity, that platform went to end. It just kind of... All right. Sure, something like that. I mean, there's definitely, I think, I mean, there's absolutely a need for resourcing every four. And, I mean, the way they do it most of the time, it's partly... Or they just don't... So I'm almost wondering, like, there is a pipeline into a lot of these, I said, even at the enterprise level. Just talking with, like, the managers that are on teams, like, the one that you were facing, and I'm, like, Hey, we'd love to talk, we can help you out from the relationship side. validate whatever bullshit this is you're making. I love it. Well, maybe, yeah, to your point, could be a future system, especially if you want to focus on this little video stuff. Which, by the way, I mean, I'm only saying S&B just because, like, that's where I wanted to go, but, I mean, enterprise pays the bills. I tell you that much. Yeah. That's what keeps the lights. So, that's an experience. And I will say from the Enterprise, at least I'm only speaking from one company so far, but my understanding of what I just shot myself into so far. Positioning ourselves on the enterprise side as a consulting company means we're not charging, like, $40 but $2 an hour. We're charging, like, $3.500 an hour. So, like, you're not fucking around with little money anymore. Like, this is a big boy, like, I'm not money an hour, like, holy fuck. But the reality is, like, in most consulting companies, like, yeah, that's, it makes sense because there's a whole team of people. But in this case, our team is the computer, JI, like... Yeah, so, I mean, imagine closing the contract, that's $100,000. That takes you two weeks to finish. It's not unpreasonable. That project that I did for the blood months ago, the only reason it lasted as long as it is, because my dumb ass, for some reason, like, this is something that actually I would look to, like, really help me make sure I keep my shit on track. I got lost in the idea and the thought that, like, I had to build, uh, what's it called? A database pipeline from their analytics into my computer and like into Superbase. And for whatever reason, I ended up spending, like, three weeks, just lost in this world, and how to build a database in ETL and pipeline. They didn't hire me to do data work. They hired me to just do strategy here at a roadmap, but obviously, I had to analyze the data. So, I got stuck in shit like that, but, like, the actual, like, analysis of the data, maybe a week. And then the actual roadmap creation, you know, because, again, it took me forever to undo what the stupid AI did. Yeah. See, weeks? Like, did I ever show you what I did to them? Nope. Yep. Um... And it's not, like, I don't know how to show you, it was essentially the final product. That, and I also, like, the mistake, I think, I also made was, I, uh, I mean, not to say that we shouldn't... We shouldn't do feedback, not with people, but... I immediately, as soon as, like, I was told, like, okay, yeah, I want to hire you to do this data related analysis. and, like, also, give us a run time. So, yeah. So this was the final deal. This is what they... Reset, collected. There you go. It was the roadmap, it was, like, all of the analysis, everything else behind me. Mm hmm. And which, by the way, all of this is just HTML, and that was cool. Yeah. I was like, I'm not bothering going into, like, ended up moving my toilet shirt, just going through this. how we trust to measure why. I don't even know what it says. It's like the AI. Wow, you're... This is cool though, dude. This looks like it has a lot of, uh, clear casa. I could see the clear casa AI results. I see I see a similar UX here, man. It's literally like the generic AI. Yeah, I do exit this morning. That's so funny. But yeah, like if you go back to like the main menu area, you'll see like all the individual down at the bottom? Oh, during the episode. Wait, no. Uh, you spoke? Sonic, where, right, Martin? Reports hub? Yeah. So if you scroll down, each of those main things is like an in-depth analysis on something. So, like, this was, this one actually is just like a how-tooth when it came to, like, trapping, like, that specific trapping, complete garbage. Like, the other ones would have, like, have charts, then we bring it, basically, turns of data into more of a narrative, telling them, like, here's a story behind this, you know, shit store that you see going on. But how did they react to this? I'm so, for I don't, I still don't understand how this is. give feedback. But, like, they keeping me nothing. I just went silent for weeks, and then, finally, the BP, like, I reached after a few weeks ago. Um, she was like, I love it, it was great. It was amazing. I was like, why didn't anybody just tell me that to start with? Because, like, I had no idea, once I gave it to them, whether or not they found it, or, like... Um, but, I seem to like it. That's sick. He liked it. So how'd you think it connected with the woman? So, I used to sit behind this leg, a trip advisor, that was a salesperson, and I mean, I never worked with her anymore. Like, I was a ski, nice store, and so pie, whatever. And then last year, right around this time, I think I actually got a lengthened posting, like, you know, I want to help all businesses out, and it's, like, whatever. So she reached out to me. She was like, I know we're not a normal business, but would you be open to, like, just giving some some project work? And she was like, I don't even know if we have any birds that figured. Like, if you're hoping. I was like, sure, like, I'll happen to have a conversation and it's like, she's like, you know, I don't let her. Yeah. And then it turned into like she came back like as we're having these back and forth conversations. So actually, we have some budgets. There's there's about 30 grand that they got a little bit. I'm like, 30 genders on the board. And I was like, I don't, what are you? I don't even know what you want me to do. Yeah. He was like, Here's a bunch of screenshots and PDFs and data. Um, the image is basically analyzes this for us and kind of tell us what's going on. Yeah. So there's another designer that I worked with on the team to do this on, and the UX, right? I'm very down. Um, and that's, and then I finished that project, and then she, like, told this other lady who I had also looked through that trip advisor. But, again, I just kind of knew her in passing. Um, and then that's when I, like, started the comic hits, and they're, like, very, like, it mock-ups and stuff and whatever it is, and then it'll just kind of turn into what it is now. Yeah. That's awesome. Pure luck. And, you know, Hepa, you know. What's happened when you're nice to people in your office, I guess. Yeah, definitely don't be an asshole, basically. Yeah, basically. Because like I never, I never would have thought our freaking rocket was like ever again in my life. Yeah. Yeah. It's dope, doggy. So, like, that's, that's, you see how, like, it's, it's not necessarily like a solution in a sense, but, like, it was, all data and strategies would blow it down to it, like, yeah. I mean, I didn't write a sandwich. Like, this, the data piece, the analysis. Yeah, this is a nice song. I mean, it absolutely needs better organization, but, like, it's literally just a bunch of python scripts. I'm not gonna open them to the looks, or... Did you give them the source code? You just gave them... Oh, I just gave him that the minimal. So like all of these are different python scripts of things of like analysis of like, oh, you know, let's say this data set that I pulled, uh, I don't know where the final is, but, like, for example, this is the data set. This data that I pulled from, uh, Guan lyrics, and now I'm on my end, I'm analyzing the shit out of it, and I'm literally just having AI write the scripts, and I'm asking these stupid questions, too, of, like, how do we create advanced end of us to solve off the list? Like, what's the most advanced form of, like, predictive analytics I can provide? Yeah. So like, I don't know what I'm doing. Yeah. But, I mean, as long as you have a general sense, I think of, like, what exists, when it comes to data and analysis, like, just money? Yeah, bro. It's so funny, this reminded me of, when I was, like, 2nd year at Microsoft, I was becoming miserable as I do after a year and a half in everywhere. I uh, one of the women I work with, her name is Kensi. She actually told the NBA, like, corporate. And she was doing events. NBA national basketball? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She was on the events teams, and I was like, fuck it, bro. I'm gonna just reach out to her. Uh, and what I provided her was just a PowerPoint deck of where I think they should have all-star weekend. It was like in Cleveland. but it was just like a bunch of cool like visuals that I built in the power of BI and there was then. She like, oh, we love it. We should apply for this job. And I made it to like the final round and they're like, they wanted me to move to New Jersey. I was like, fuck it, I'm in the Lakers. So then I backed out and then we haven't talked since, but like, it seems like very similar where it's just like, build the thing for, send it to the person that's responsible for making the decision and see if they was fine. More or less. It's basically a LinkedIn lead is basically how you got this. No, I mean, no, even. Yeah, but that's interpoles. Yeah. But, honestly. Again, I'm not, like... small business side, I'm definitely aware, you're not gonna make the same kind of money. Enterprise is targets, okay. Yeah. I think we should separately explore and go. I mean, honest. way more efficiently. These motherfuckers are buying, like, eccentric Delorte, I'm sure. Which is ass, bro. Fucking extent. think I might have told you before. Excentric charge, state of California, I think it was, like, half a million dollars to run a survey, monkey survey, and put the results in the album. $500,000 for a search of my service. This guy that was telling me, he was, like, bragging about it. And I was like, dude, you can do some shit.. Yeah. Like, I think as long as I, for example, in the contact, NBA, I think would be a great person for us to be like, Hey, um, the beer's what we do. Here's where we can do it. I'd love to help. Yeah. Because then it becomes a conversation of, like, you know, they're not... They're not extincture. We not doing white. Yeah. You're more, too, 19, that can actually, like, move faster than them, great better for shit than them. Yeah. I hope it's completely informed. I've seen the weird data says. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But I want to make sure that we can leave here tonight with, like, actually something solid. I think I should definitely reach out to my cousin. and just, like, see what he says. Yeah. Um, see if he's even open to anything, but... I'll also reach out to my brother, Aslin. Okay. Because... I think I took those in San Francisco. So he's been having contact with a lot of startups. Everything is describing to me about them, 'cause, obviously, like, he lives in this TikTok social media one, whatever it is, so, like, his failing to realize that, like, what you're actually offering them is not fucking TikTok. Like, they're giving them insights on their customers. Because everything he's telling me is, like, yeah, people are commenting, they're giving this feedback about the product, and they're saying, oh, shit, and, like, these companies are pivoting based on, like, TikTok comments. Well, I got some questions, like, how do you know that that post was the right one for that audience? Or, like, how do you know this is the right thing for that? I mean, like, it was like, I don't know. So, my brother is, like, basically out there, like, yanking the, like, startups that, like, are getting a millions of dollars per day. I don't see anything. We can't go into it like that. How about we actually show you how to actually find product or make things? Like, kind of actually understand your user data, to actually, like, use that information, to find your right president. Because for what he's telling me, it's, like, I know there are, like, these young 20 year old people that are, like, these fucking kids, yeah. You're nerdy. I mean, I'm not, like, I think that both of them haven't even hit 25, though. And, like, they're just having money, and they're blowing it on the thing, and nothing. Oh, bullshit. Yeah, I think those are too good. It's actually what I could leave immediate value. Do we have a landing page, something to send somebody to say, This is what we do? So, I'm kind of hoping, like, you can help balance me on this. I have the habit on... I have probably, like, 100 lines crazy. Oh, really? Somewhere... somewhere in this mess, there's probably easily, like, post to a hundred landing, and across all of the projects. On a single one, we've never gotten her. Because I always end up falling in the trap where, like, I start, and I'm like, Oh, that's nice. Now let me just ask it for one more thing. Let me ask you to look at it from this day. And then all of a sudden, I get to the end of the day, and I'm like, fuck it, I'll do it, tomorrow, and then, then, tomorrow, I'm gonna fucking... Um, so, yeah, I have mining pages for all kinds of different projects, but I have never gotten. But even just for rethread. I... So, Rita is an interesting one, but first of all, like, is that what we're doing? Is that what we're calling it? I mean, rethread is, there's something that, like, again, I got, that was just something like, I wanted to start your on the side. I'm not saying, like, you should call Earth. Okay. Okay, it's just full name. And if you want something else, we can definitely go to something else or not. Yeah, I mean, that kind of stuff went down. I mean, if you have it, and it's attached to something that's real, you have some recognition, at least from one brand, why not stick with it? Unless you want to keep it as your own thing. No, although, like, Rutford collected that one, now I'm very established. That one like that. Oh, that's right. No, no, no, so there's two things. We're at the Reflective, because the company I'm gonna work for with... And at this point, it's, like, that's the one client housing. Well, that machine's gonna have already moved. Yeah. Now, greath thread was something, like, that was supposed to be a playoff. That's the only bright side, there's, like, some mediocre space out of it. Great. Um, but again, I'm not, like, I could just have that be, like, my own, like, random shit I'm doing. Yeah, definitely, we can watch some games, so then I end up being two of us, we should definitely do that. Okay. So we're... The name I'm not by any means that true. Yeah, okay. So what I can do is, it sounds like two things you've mentioned was like, hey, I have these great ideas. I go in a tangent, nothing that's published, which is cool. I think I could help there. And we put together, as you find, those leads, a proposal just for a landing page to basically summarize what we do. Um, and maybe a little bit of a process around. Okay, if we get a lead, what's the first step? How do we go across connectors, like, in operation, or what? So, to go to somewhere? lead to actual execution. Yes. And then I'm just gonna chip. This is my initial thought. get back together out of something, call, adjust where my phone is. That would be huge, 'cause, honestly, I mean, for mine, even, like, even with the Japan project, it's literally just, like, I still am regular into it, and I'm like, I'll just see what it takes me. Yeah. Um, and the huge lesson in my wife and I have told you, like, she's crazy shit. The only thing about it, this time around, she's like, You have to get a fucking processing place. Because last time around, I mean, I was working ridiculous hours, just because, like, I had no idea what I was doing. There was no process, nothing. Yeah, so that, I think, would be huge. Like, I mean, just knowing what to get from the client, whoever step forward for ingredients, anything like that, that would be massively helpful. Okay, shit. Yeah, I'll work on that piece, 'cause, you know, that's what I did, and Microsoft was, to see, it was the customer experience, where is that like? A bunch of people gave us a bunch of shit, and it was our job to just synthesize it into actual environments and personal things. So, I can go. been, what, a year since I did that? There's infinite can out there, I can come up with a thing. Okay, this is how we operate as a team. At least my thought. You actually have applicability, a real example. Bring it to you and be like, based on what you actually think, which you're saying might not be the right approach. What of this process will work for system? You can just pick it, okay? I mean, I think ultimately, like, if we just approach it less, like, more so from, you know, we're, we want to understand problems and how we solve them, and maybe software, and maybe assign standing on the side of the street with the signs. I mean, probably not, but the idea of being that, like, we understand, we will understand the problem, and we'll find the right solution for it. That problem might need, you know, I'm not getting enough customers in the door on Friday nights, or it might be, we have this, you know, this process that needs completely shaken. Um, so, I mean, it's... it could be any, in my opinion, 'cause it's as cocky as it sounds, really, I mean, with the power of the ship that you have, like, there's very few things they don't pick with movies. So is that our mission statement? Like, makes sense. data driven... validation. Look, I've really got problems, regardless of the industry, with... That's not what we're starting. Because that could be it, and I'm cool with it, but I heard him, he's talking out of my ass, but, like, no, yeah, I'm just workshipping. Yeah, do workshop. I think we have to manage vertical with breadth. Yeah. Yeah. If we're building something for every morning, everything, I feel like we might get in the position of having nothing. I think if you have your two leads, it's transportational, and... startups. Let's just pretend that's what we do for now. I think that's a much smarter right now. And if it's not... Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, let's just pretend, and that's the beauty of these AIs is like, I told the fucking lawyer dude that I do this for a living. And I gave him a website that was bullshit. And whether or not he doesn't have to know that it's, I've never done it before, which is pretend like my deal. 'Cause they're not gonna sanity check us. Unless they're gonna make the LinkedIn, it's only pivoting. Fuck it. Remind me of something else. So, um... In some instances, altogether, I don't even think we'd ever have to, like, build anything at all. And I think the transportation latents one might actually be like this, just because we know it well enough that I think, you know, we could use what you've built, we can use, you know, what we know about, like, this, this, and bullshit. Yeah. Um, but, like, for example, this one, this was just a random idea. My brother was in... I remember where he was. Shit. Transform email chaos into business intelligence, the 1st thing I platformed up for businesses that treats you in boxes of database support. I'll explain to you why I'm showing you this here. Okay. It's pretty cool. I don't know how much this actually makes sense, but like, how real does this look to you? This looks a tip, like, this is a real product of what business. Yeah. This is complete bullshit. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. There's no such thing as this shit. But, I mean, all the value props, everything on here, that is, in fact, what, like, you know, what would have solved the problem that my brother found when he was talking to my uncle, and he was like, yeah, like, you've got Billy Nina knows we don't know what to do. This is actually another interesting problem. Yeah, it is. Yeah. But to your point, I think this proves that, like, rethread or whatever the fuck we end up calling it, could be anything. This is something that I think it would produce. So, for example, let's say, like, the transportation, we definitely need, like, our business. Like, this is what our business is called. Shit like this is, like, going to my cousin, or, like, you know, other transportation businesses and being, like, book, we have, you know, here's this, here's this software that exists. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't actually have things still. And essentially waiting till we can find a customer that'll bite on it. Yeah. And then after you host. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Like at the bottom right, they'll say powered by rethreat. whatever it is, whatever it is. That's exactly it. Yeah, yeah. Email for 2020 so far, right, deserve. But no, I think we're on the same page. Like, the, it's almost like a tree. It's like there's the master organization that works building all of these kind of empty solutions that don't exist until we can prove that there's a use case where someone says they'll buy it, then we just get on a fucking call and hack it out and do it. And then we present it together. Well, say we're customizing it for the problem. I like it. So we're not actually wasting time building anything without actual revenue. No. And, I mean, the other thing, too, is, like, with some of this stuff, is that, like, again, I mean, we want to make sure we're staying in the vertical, like you were saying, we're focused on those, but that said, something as simple as a landing page, I think opens to the blue any press, then, to be like, you know what, let's just get on product hunt or I need or any of these others. Just like just post it and see what happens. I mean, maybe there's, like, 50 people that sign up for the Lutes of Data list. Okay, let's... Let's ask them question. Let's see what they'll say. So that's another thing, too. Like for me, it's like, I built shit like this. Is that even right? But then I never get it on. I don't, I don't know what the hell is going on in my head, but, like, minus... It never makes it pass me a lot. And then that's where I think our working relationship develops is... I'm very cool with, again, and obviously contribute. Like, you're the ideals guy, I help execute. And maybe it's vice versa, but if where our strong suits are, we'll figure it out. They don't. I mean, for me, what I've always liked black news, that it's always like, Okay, let's just fucking do it, and all of a sudden, it's like, I did it. Yeah, exactly. Oh, shit. Because fuck, I mean, we can do it. And that's like when, especially, dude, when I was in MIS, uh, I always had this weird insecurity about not being the guy who could build the fucking thing. Like, even when I do the hackathon, like, I was always, like, I should have just stuck in CS because all these guys are building actual things. And I'm just giving direction, and it feels like I'm kind of useless. That's why I hated the PM work I have for softness. I was just a jockey of ideas for people that were more senior than me. I didn't give a fuck about what they were doing. And I can't actually implement anything different. I used power apps, and it got me promoted once or twice, but it took me fucking 50 hours, I think, outside of my day job to get some stuff like that done. So, like, now, like, we can just actually build the fucking. We can just do it. Yeah, it might be bad. Honestly, I mean, especially with, like, things and you're fighting with Gemini, I make a locus, uh, one, five, but... I'm actually very surprised, unless there'd be no ho, essentially. All of the treats. Obviously, I can't read the code. I compare it to, like, 6 punks, like, if I'm just trying to use, like, claw and pork for example, it was just constantly hitting here. You never know if you'd like... Every other hour, you're just like, okay, I guess this is gonna be where I'm stuck with for the rest of the day. Now it's actually, like, okay, so fucking fix the shit. Yeah. Like, now, actually, the limitation for me is more so, like... This, this, this. The fact that I have so many fucking things... It's like, I can't, I don't. I'm supposed to be on my ADX team edge, but, like, it's fine. Let me, let me, let me ask you this. I know this is something you and I, I think, harped on when we 1st tried this, what, two, 3 years of... How do we... I'm down with executing. I'm a conbon. I use Trevor. How do we communicate? Your roots and ideas. Prioritize those ideas. 'Cause I'll build the plan. I'll build my PMs and idea. the operation workflow. So what platform have you used that's worked for you? Honestly, I get a dumber. Don't give it up. Yeah. You don't give it to me. Just let her laugh. I moved from one thing to the next, and I was like, let's use this one. Actually, no, let's... I'm not the type of person that I should ever have off of this. Yeah. I should get the dollar million, nothing else. Yeah. Um, just told what to go. Just don't, don't. Tell me what happens, you can... I mean, even in terms of, like, ideas, thoughts like that, like, like you said, like, this is not... It's not my stuff. This should be hours. It's our state. Um... That set, like... To your point, exactly, I definitely think you should have an initial caucus, and, like, just just prank that out to start with. Yeah. Um, I really like the upwork stuff as, like, an initial, like, thing for us to do, just because it can be much easier for us to coordinate it and get moving on it fast while we're still, like, figuring out, like, did my cousin even respond, or, again, ended up getting some startups, anything like that? Yeah, it does. But, like, what are you believing about that? For sure. I don't know if upwork allows, so here's my upwork profile. I definitely, I've seen like agencies on their, like, businesses, but I don't know how they, like, what their setup is. And all I did was just have AI build mine, but when I did that, literally like a day and a half ago, I can't submit anymore composals because of my identity foot. Yeah, I just put the 3 things that I built in the portfolio, put that amount of hours, the skills, and it just, my resume, and that's it, and it's just been submitting proposals. Um, and it's telling me they're getting viewed, but no one's fucking actually doing anything on it, at least yet. Um, and I just built a clod fig to, uh, basically a clod project to, uh, Whereas, let's just ChatGPT. Yeah, I'll pork opportunity evaluators. I'm just throwing every opportunity into it and based on a subset of instructions. It tells me whether or not I'm a fucking idiot. It's like, go do this. And I was just, give me a rating. like, yeah, go submit it. I'm like, okay, well, if the fit scores 8 out of 10, then create the proposal. doesn't submit it. It has worked here. Um, but I don't, I haven't seen an agency on here yet, but you can see if it's allowed and just create one. I guess I haven't seen them in the sense of like, and maybe an official, but I've definitely interacted with and... A dude who's a part of an agency. Like, he's representing one, because it was very clear that it's like, yeah, we have a team, da da da. And I was like, oh, I thought I was, you know, one person. It's cool. Yeah, we could do the upwork angle because we have the leads. Yeah, okay. So that'll be, maybe I remix this upward, upward profile to reference the organization that we are the, uh, consultancy that we have created. Yeah, I mean, I think you should definitely still keep your own, because we never know. Like, I mean, I'm sure you might have projects you want to do on your own and stuff. So I've actually never submitted or like I've, I've submitted a project to get proposals on, but I don't know why I've never like bothered actually like proposing stuff. So, like, I think that, I think we could figure out how to do it efficiently, where it's, like, let's say we can figure out how to cut that time down to, like, 10 hours a week of just, like, pushing proposals out. Yeah. The maximum number proposal we can't. Yeah. Um, maybe that's, like, one of the first things we do. Like a, like a scope, like a scraper to auto submit proposals. Maybe not necessarily auto snacks. I definitely think we should, like, we should find the ones, like, for example, let's find transportation specific companies, one of them. Yeah, no. And, like, just study them and see, like, what we can find. This is, like, politics, but I'm not just telling you. Yeah, for sure. Um, I'm down for that. And just kind of seeing, like, what we're asking for, seeing if we can find commonalities between them, and then maybe from there, we start being, like, Okay, let's how can we actually build ourselves in the workflow or process to where we can look at these on Monday? By Wednesday, we have proposals, like, 20 proposals out to all these different things I end up with. Yeah. Um, and maybe it's not just upwards, like, uh, because I'm sure there's so, there's many other, uh, native profile on Contro was another one. Yeah. I don't know. one's kind of weird, cool. And there was one that I used called... or I was gonna use. I took a screenshot of it. It was called... Bark and True Lancer, where the other two that I saw at Reddit, that I haven't looked into yet, 'cause I was just starting with this. interesting. Yeah, I like that idea, bro. We could, I wonder if there's an API that we could use or like some sort of scraper that lets us pull up work stuff. That would be fucking dangerous. Just pull it into our own shit and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, and it was filter out things unrelated to a subset. Yeah. But, yeah, the thing the thing about upwork, man, is like even if you look at it, You scroll down here. This one was post an hour going, already has between 20 to 50 proposals. Like you got to move quick. Um... So we're literally kind of playing a maxim... Yeah, playing a big field here. So I think it's something worth looking to, but I just, you know, keep that in mind is that, like... You should definitely not be our primary. Yeah, these Indian dudes will undercut it, right? You put a proposal up for like... So I guess from 139 hours of work and he was only built 175 bucks. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. That's not worth our time at all. At all. Yeah, that's the thing. And he was paid $6 an hour. for healthcare and cold calling. And I'm not saying yet, but this is not stuff we're gonna do, but I'm just saying it's like, and, you know, there are some legitimate proposals here, but this is $50, $60 an hour shit. like. Yeah, 126 hours for 620 billion. I think the thing that's interesting with Upwork is like, I guess, and I don't understand why enough, but like my interpretation of it or like my view of it at this point seems like if we can figure out how to get as close to automated as possible with it, then maybe it's worth our time. Yeah. Because I didn't realize how many people are actually submitting on a per job thing. that puts us in a position which we might invest 10 hours to like submit these and then, you know, we're just wasting it. Yeah, and I'm going to keep an eye on it because I'll keep on submitting as individuals, but, um, Yeah. It's definitely, uh, it's definitely saturated. Fortunately, our unfortunate. Yes, what? Yeah, I guess the other challenge would be... This is that, like, you're limited just to, like, whatever you're being scoked for, whatever you're... Versus, like, I guess we were going to a small business around here, it becomes, all right, like, let's go see what all we can get our hands on. Yeah. I mean, ultimately, the way I'm, like, the way I see it is, like, we can get our hands on data on numbers in any capacity, even if it's just initially for free. That gives us the ability to quantify a problem and say, here's a solution that's solved exactly like the pharmacy problems. Yeah. I think that princess is in a much more powerful position to be like, You're spending $10,000 a month on warship. Let's cut that down at five, and we're gonna charge you 10 grand so that you're not doing that at that. I don't even know if that math makes sense, but, like, point is, like, being able to actually get our hands on the data that gives us the justification to a small business. We're gonna cut your cost, you know, whatever it is, it's simple. And I think that's something we can at least estimate quantifications are, yeah. That is very true. Like, at minimum, we should be able to estimate it, just, you know, using ChatGPT, whatever it is, like, going into, like, a, uh, transportation business, like, you're probably spending this number of hours on this bullshit. Um... Challenge always is a small business, but it's, like, professionalism is the wrong word, but, like, understanding of, or, like, the ability to actually, like, get their head wrapped. Like one of my dad is telling him, like, well, I'll go do this thing. It going to save you a 100 hours a week. It's gonna be like... I have to learn something new. That's exactly how it's been. I guess, like, oh, my God, dude, yeah. Even all the winning T-flow, it's very blue caught. Software. I have software. hang on. See? Um... What, that's the thing, with some of these demos, you can say, you know, say $500 a week, here's how, since we was, or show up after they're going. You like fucking think through this. Yeah, you... Well, I guess, do you, given, 'cause I really don't realize how many people are actually submitting on your product, today is probably different than that. Okay, absolutely. And, like, when the first one was this cool? Just, like, go hard on trying to find, like, local small distance. I think a better use of our media time. Because this is something I'm gonna probably be doing when I get bored anyway. So I'll see if there's something here for us. Thus far, it's not looking bad, but it's been 2 days. I know, it's definitely very saturated. I know, yeah, yeah, yeah. And frankly, like, even if I'm looking at the competition for the proposals, I have submitted. People are willing to do the work for a lot less to land, right? So, I can keep on hacking on that on the side. I think, if we simultaneously... reach out to the leads, Nah. I love it. You've identified and then potentially do some data mining. So... legitimate businesses, using cursor, ChatGPT, that have repeatable processes that you originally said, I mean, no cost money. We can, basically, be our own consultants at first. If we're offering what people for offering consultancy to people, and we can't consult ourselves into a client base, we're probably fucked anyway, right? Like, let's, maybe that's, that's one I can immediately try to do is be like... What is, what vertical is worth most of our time from, like, a manual hours perspective, or adults? And then, I still think the idea of, like, Okay, we have your cousins transportation business, we have my NBA contact. Let's just build the gummy front end websites. Start reaching out to them and being like, Hey, well, part is loose thread, whatever, consulting, this is what we do. Would you be down for 15 and call for us? Sure. See you. We doing, I think if we're doing that, some time in parallel, those will converge eventually where we have the data. We tried it with these people we know already. They said yes or no. Now we have data to support who we're gonna tackle next. And we just start trapping weeds. Like battles. Because the other thing, too, like, even with the transportation beans, definitely, you can just, like, I guess maybe small businesses are wrong to work to be using, but, like, in terms of the size of the businesses that are probably going to be worth our time, I don't think it will be, like, our dad's business. I mean, where my cousin's running now, I probably, they're probably big enough that we could get away with part of the imitation amount of things. Okay, I know they're making money, like, easily, like, $1 million here. Um, so, like, we could definitely grow around and charge a decent amount of money, but, like, that room transportation goes down the street, I think, is an example of something else that could be, like, a valuable target in the sense of, like, this is a national company, technically. Um, but they've to operate in like 1975. There's no reason we shouldn't be able to charge them like... I mean, when I say charging them, like, this amount of money, like, for, you know, upwork stuff. Not that those are bad job, in a sense, but from, you know, especially if you're saying that somebody's are, like, $40, $50 an hour, comparison with somebody, you know, let's say something like that company down the street, I think there's no reason we couldn't get away with charging, like, $2, $300 an hour, and stuff. Um, So, in terms of, like, target clients, that, kind of, I think the trans, like, feeling, the cutoff might be for us, and so, especially make it worth it, would be, like, they're, they're not quite, like, for local law and pop shops, but they might be local in the sense, like, you know, they're, they're decent sized companies. you know, probably at least maybe 50, 100 employees in some instances. Yeah. Um, maybe like a $1000000 in revenue or something like that. Like, actually poops that it's worth our time. Because at the end of the day, like, we don't want to go into this just to, like, keep the lights on. Let's make our salary that we used to make and more. There's no reason we shouldn't be able to. Exactly. I don't think we should I 100% agree. Um, the analysis piece of it would be interesting. Like, identifying what problems are you gonna do, come up with the solution. I think that's an interesting base. I think that's where, where we basically make the case for ourselves. We're like, yeah, we're gonna charge you $50,000 to build you a landing page. Because we know it's gonna make you $2 million. Yeah. And that type of ability debates can be, like, we know, because we looked at your data, like, you can't, you're not gonna blow jails. Um, but then also, like, as opposed to coming at it, because I'm sure a lot of these companies are probably getting hit by all kinds of just bullshit, like, what make you whatever you want technically. You know, I'm sure you've seen plenty of this stuff, LinkedIn messages or whatever. Um, it's just kind of really approaching it less so from, I guess, specifically from just, we've built apps and websites, and more so from, like, the perspective of, I don't want to say problem solving, because, like, it's very broad, but, like, at the end of the day, like, it's finding the right problem and solving it for them. That's exactly, like, kind of what I'm doing with the design air size of, like, except I'm not the one building anything, because I've just been on my size. But the first part of, like, that roadmap I showed you is basically just a prioritize system of shit, where essentially I told them, like, your number one issue is actually only the fact that you don't have track in the place. Nothing else matters until you get that. Like, that alone is probably worth $10 million because you're losing money left and right because you have no idea where it's going. Um, so the solution there wasn't to actually build anything. Let's just go get your tracking, shit in place. The next problem being, for example, like the mobile piece, they have a mobile site, but it's garbage. Here's the proof to why that should be the next thing otherwise. I mean, it's just the same shit we've been doing, right? Like, corporate. Like, I'm just gonna collect the proof priorities. Validating problems. Exactly. I believe, even though they have. As opposed to kind of what I'm assuming a lot of these companies are, a lot of these, like, AI coming through and they're like, we'll automate everything for you. And I was like, how do you even know that's the right thing to do? Like maybe the company doesn't need anything automated. They might need it not automated in some ways. don't know. So anyways, they just came out of... No, no, I think you're right. I see what you were told. Maybe... to start. We, I don't know, I guess I'm struggling between, like, starting macro and man, like, hey, scraper, pull every major to mid market transportation organization and the Pima County. Once we have that list, start finding ways to data minor systems data, or what problems they might have. Whether it's, like, you know a guy that uses Hudson or some way to find out that they use, you know, X, Y, and Z, and then seeing if, like, okay, if there's 10 of these and 2 some, and 4 of them have the same problem. Can we build a bullshit front inside that says it solves the problem? Pitch them on the problem, get a contract, and then just put the solution there. I 100% think so. I mean, I definitely think we should not make the same mistake I've made for three years, which is like, let me build this, and then see where it's like, that's not the time. Yeah. No more, no more wasting time building shit that no one's ever going to sleep. I mean, granted, I think the joke was pretty probably poor stuff. I think so too. Yeah, I'm just don't want to, at some point, get rest of the paint. I still think it's a whole idea, not for you. I think we're kind of circling back to, like, I think, where we start, where we leave the tangible things, and, well, I'm gonna probably look into tonight, and, you know, I was like, again, you had a good idea at the beginning of this. You can probably date a mine who uses bullshit Hudson. Or a date of mine who uses whatever bullshit that we might identify, who's a marketplace. Like, I think finding a breadth, a single problem that has threatened across multiple companies. And then it's like, oh, what's our vertical economies? Where our focus is? Like, if we can clean... Five companies making a million dollars in annual revenue have the same issue, we could get a one of five successor, if one got to give us some guard and do it. That's true, I know. Yeah? Yeah. Maybe that's the coach. So, I guess, do we decide transportation is our personal? I guess, I mean, what if we literally approach it from, like, let's just run our shit in springs? Yeah. The first group, we're gonna run week one, is, we're gonna try and hit, we're gonna try and head up to the experience for personal places. Yeah. I'll see what you got. Monday, like in the scraping, we eat. Monday, we just try to remember. We decide on the target market. We decide on, like, people. I mean, maybe we're not eating the street. We literally have even know the five already. Yeah. Or we just pick very specific bibles. There we go. Yeah, agile sprints. Fucking. And then by Wednesday, we have our knockups or whatever it is, whatever our pitch would be that we were at personally, and then by, you know, say Thursday. Um, this is the part, you know, because we lost, and it's, like, somehow getting communication, the dental thing, and something. Yeah. And, I mean, what would happen, I'm assuming, is, like, no one's gonna respond immediately. Yeah, which would lead us into week two, for, like, you know, let's say the next member, like, okay, now we're gonna do the next part of public. In the process, we're still running stuff on that first one. It, yeah. Which is kind of like 2 weeks. maybe the 2nd sprint is actually in the same vertical, but like the next 5 companies. Yeah, yeah. Probably the side. Yeah. And it'll be our combined responsibility to, Go past the idea of, I found 5 companies in Tucson that lack legitimate certification tracking and dig down, build a very small version of what you did for Japan airlines. I found this and here's some market research. Like every item on our sprint board is actual market research. Obviously, we use climb. don't fucking do it by hand. But something to validate, and you can all copy, okay. This is my, we have 3 things on my backlog. Which one? Because it doesn't have to be any MT. I say, you pick 2 things you're interested in, I'll pick two. The other one that was going on in my head is, Roger, my therapist sends me therapy homework every time I see it. And it's, it's shining. Maybe it's personal. It's like bullshit, but it's like 4 questions. And I'm like, I get the homework and I'm like, I don't know what to do with that. Do I write it in a Google Doc and do I send it to them? Okay. Do I? There's another person. Yeah, yeah. So my therapist is kind of just thinking, well, 1st of all, right, she's just, she's an old next piece. Yeah, yeah. And, um, it's actually, like, kind of hinted at times. Yeah, you've wanted to build me more outside of the box. But, like, there were operations, like, from where she does stuff. Definitely a much better way to do it. She's always been complained about the fact, but, like, her, she's tried hiring, like, her attorney, like, grandkid or something, to, like, put the fresh asking for it, it was a disaster, and she has a lot of those paperwork, she was... So maybe that's another vertical. Make yours, it has a ten. Yeah, I mean, maybe there's a compict of interest there with telling your therapist, like, I'll blub your shift. Okay. Roger asked me to build him an app for the book he wrote. So, even better. Yeah, yeah. So I don't I don't think I... he wrote a book. I actually read it was really good, but it's called Lingering Lies. You ever want to check it out? He's like, I want an AI and bought pet. basically does what the book that guides my clients through the exercises that are in the book. Yeah, okay, so this, I'm definitely going off topic. Um, I have had this, I thought this is for a while, though, that I believe that I believe there's a massive opportunity of turning content into interactive experiences. Did I ever tell you about the, I can't, did I mention to you the whole, um, uh, Sahawa and, like, profit? Uh, maybe. I'm gonna go show to you sometime. Um, but essentially, like, there was a job back at Lane Institute, where all my spinning men, the M works, and, uh, essentially, like, they had some, was her product manager job, and I really wanted, but, but I thought, okay, I'll apply, and I'll also, like, build this cool thing. But essentially what it was. you get your... So, um, my thought with it, though, is like, that's literally just taking the content that these organizations already have, those business already has, and literally just putting in a format that allows people to interact with it. But doing so in a way that lets them do things like back engagement, try, you know, putting together, like, upsill opportunities or, like, let's say in the case of a nonprofit, you're creating more touch points for them to donate money, to get more money. So, like, all of these, you know, you take what is, you know, a YouTube video or static content, you turn it into something, interact, it's gonna be quite engaged, but something people can track with over time, like, in the case of, like, therapy piece. Um, and you're tracking progress or tracking, like, so now it's more than just I wrote, of course. It's like, wow. Like, I actually have the lessons I learned and things I did. Such an interesting idea. And how you data mine that is, you find authors with subtraction on Amazon, not too much. You pay for an e-book, throw it in the clod, and you extract the activities or the guidance that's given in the book, create the app, and then you send it to the author. Be like, hey, I was moved by your book. So, that's kind of shitty to say. I was moved by your book. Give a shit about it. I'm a developer. I thought it would be cool too. Bring it to life. Bring it to life. I'm I'm not I'm not gonna do anything with this. It your IP. If it's something you're interested as a next step. for your already existing readers. Let us know. So, like, these are interesting things because, like, these are things that we can absolutely do, like, on a consistent base. I mean, it could literally even be the things that we actually fight. Yes. You know, I mean, maybe there's a certain book that we dislikers or whatever it is, or like a certain YouTube YouTuber or something like that. Um, whatever it might be, like, just throw into this week's spring or something. That's what happens. It's like, it's not even that it's like becomes our soul foot when it's Yeah. So, like, what's interesting at this point, I think, about all the things we discussed, number one, 1st of all, we should absolutely rein me in and like, let's actually take one operation. Number two, I think it also opens up, you know, for us to have, like, all these other smaller things, like, just in between. there's no way we're gonna spend, you know, 7 days of a sprint, just trying to find transportation businesses. Like, at some point we're going to the AirPI. Yeah. I have time. Let's do something else. So, bidding in, like, these small, like, you know, I would say they're relatively small projects, especially because they're just, like, essentially proposals. And seeing where they go, I think would be another interesting thing, like, you couldn't go to these things. Um, and before I forget, because you remind me of, like, the idea of, like, basically sharing research or, like, us having research or, like, you use the Nobook LM, yeah? I have it. So it's actually pretty interesting. So this is like, this is this is their app. It's from Google. The chances are these fucking assholes will pull the plug on it. So yeah, like, you know, here's here's another one. It was okay for me to click it. Yeah, I mean, these are all just like article things that I poured into. Okay, got you. Um, this one might actually like not be the best example, because it doesn't have as much. Yeah. Here we go. modern aviation. So, in this case, like, I actually asked you to basically bring the research. I gave it a topic and then it went and pulled the resources. So, like, it it got all of these resources. on the airline business. And then it turns it into any of these things that you want. So you can turn into a podcast, you can turn into all this stuff. Here, for example, we're like the info graph that get made off of the data from those sources, but it's like, it's just industry research that I'm asking for. So things like this, I think would another would be another interesting thing for us to kind of fit in there. Whether we want to share it on LinkedIn or whether we want to share it directly, let's say, to a business, um, like, well, let's say we have a transportation one specific like this, and reach out to, like, be like, hey, you know, we're, we do research and we, you know, on the, uh, we do make ourselves sound pants or whatever. selling company with research dot dot. Here's a really cool looking geographic. I'd love to talk if you guys ever joined. I feel like that, I think, would also be an interesting... Really cool. Yeah. So you have an immediate proposition, be like, not only do we have this idea, but here's, here's free knowledge. Free knowledge. I mean, like, I didn't smart. fucking... It's awesome. I think, I think, I think it's like, I'm almost imagining like a Trello board, but like each item on it is a slide decker, a notebook LM, like that shows. Okay, here's my idea. Here's the very bare bones AI-based research. Shoot me a ping. Hey Mo, guys, go look at this. What do you think? Okay, cool. I'll have it. Let's think about it for the next spring and I could just... I really like, I like the, like, the processed gold. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. This is actually really nice in the sense, especially for what you said of like being able to just do initial research. And then we could literally ask you whatever the hell you want. Like, dump your topic, it will go fine. give any of these. Yeah. They will go find the, you know, I mean, you know it works. Unrelated might have to show you this other app that I just got. Have you heard of rodeo? What is it? Rodeo? No, is that? It's the...Fuck it, yeah, why not? Okay, sprint one, transportation businesses. Um, I believe my dad might actually still have a contact at room. that, uh, I don't know how cool she is with him, but it might be an end. Yeah. So I'll ask him and see if he has a thing, and then I'll follow, I'll shoot my cousin a text and see if he wants to talk. Yeah. Um... And then, oh, well, I don't want to beat us on topic, but, please, from the startup side of the world, get to that sprint. Why Combinator has all their shit published? Like every startup there is all just public. So, we could definitely just scrape that. I'm sure there's probably already public scrapers that pull out stuff. Yeah. Um, but just finding specific startups on there. I kind of started doing this last year. Yeah. of just looking to find the founder, you get their LinkedIn is right there and everything, like... I mean, there's a lot of times they're like 34 people teen, but like, these guys have three, four, five, $10 million in funding in some assistance. So it's not like these had, you know, this is nobody companies. Um, but that's another, I think, another interesting place for us to kind of go mind data when we get there, like startups and stuff, that, I mean, they're, the information is just there. Yeah. Um, so just going and thinking it up. Yeah, sounds good. But for spring, I don't know, and I think the idea of generalizing what we were in the building. I think considering the compliance police... HIPLA will likely have to be a consideration for any transportation company that's working at the scale of Zoom or whatever. Hip hop? I think so, right? Because we capture any client information, pick up drop off times. I'm sure I'm sure they're doing some sort of old folks home and non-emergency medical transportation at some scale, if it's not for excess, uh, maybe we'll see. I mean... Well, I guess it depends. Actually, there's a good verification. So, this is a good, good thing, or we're discussing this. So from my end, the way the world that I'm looking at, the world, I'm living in is the airport transportation good system. So that's probably why I didn't even think about stuff. Whether or not that's the right move, I don't know. But like the transportation business in the my cousin's running is airport. Like, what, like, good, like, what, taking people to an airport? Yeah. Um, same thing with Broom, but here's the thing, though. like 2 completely different models. So, the room... Wait, these guys operate, I think they might actually operate in both ways, depending on, like, what location, like, the agency got on with them. With them, you have to go to their location, and you get on the van, and then it just goes. So, like, their schedule's very simple. Like, every hour, the shell is going, we just need... There's not much to it. With what they're doing in Phoenix, it's like, cousin, what he needs? Um, they will go pick you up from your homes and then pick up, like, have you ever read in Super Shuttle? No, way back in the day, so, no. Supercello used to do the same thing. Pick you up from your house, they'll pick up somebody else from the house, maybe one more person, and then they'll go to the airport. So introduces a whole new layer of perplexity because now with a sudden you're coordinating, you know, you have to figure out how to optimize the route for, you know, the driver on a date on a time. There's a whole mess of shit. Um, so it's definitely 2 completely different problems, which Hudson does technically solve both, you know, they offer both logistical, I think. And there's a bunch of other models, you know, them to. So I think that's another piece too that will be... Which, of course, then, you know, I'm thinking about the medical transportation site, it's a whole other model of things. Yeah, man. But I wonder if there's aspects of the depository I've created that could be leverageable, at least even for a demo, who's a pain. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Because at least it captures trips. How much you're getting billed? Like I'll show you my dad's... I don't even know if I ever actually showed you the inside. No, you definitely showed me some of it. But yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, it's like a transportation. So there's a dispatch piece, there's a statistics aspect. So absolutely. Fuck, I lost Wi-Fi. But I'm saying what I can do as a part of Sprint one is see if there's a way I could generalize. Because this is very particular to access any EMT businesses. Like, uh, generalize the code here a bit or the actual implementation of it. Yeah, so basically here's the incomplete means my brother hasn't done his part on the access side. This means Ahmed hasn't done his part. Um, and it's basically just using, um, think about selenium, but playwright scripts to do each of the automations. You could check the claim status. You could go back on subset dates. when it provides. So which ones have been complete versus incomplete. And then something I added recently is the ability to track whether or not you've been paid, by confirming it, by checking the claim status on access itself, and then just actual reporting. Um, a show like, you know, for a particular equipment of time. You know? services, total trip miles, estimated revenue, services filed versus complete what the completion rape is, that sort of thing. It's kind of, that's just been it so far. But I don't know if this is even applicable to Hudson. At least elements of it could be leveraged. Definitely some pieces. I think that's, that, that, there's probably a good thing we're having this conversation, because there's, there's definitely pieces of it that are, uh, like, for example, with the Hudson side, they have 2 pieces that I remember very clearly. There was a dispatch side and then there's the reservation side. Reservation side is pretty straightforward. That's, you know, mega booking. Nothing much to it. But it's directly connecting dispatch side, and the dispatch side is where things get more complicated, because that's where you're coordinating and you're figuring out, um, the driver, the day, the time, like the band, even some bands, it's out of commission, but it's not. And then the route, and that was always the biggest bitch for them. But, um, so, like, let's say you have somebody who lives in, you know, you're picking up three people, and they're, like, separate, separate years of town. What's the right way to route that driver to save gas to make sure that you're actually getting to the airport the fastest? Are they also leaving around the same time, you know, departing around the same time? So like that part itself actually was one of the biggest pain in the assets. And he used to take somebody, I think, like almost 20 hours a week just to, like, figure out that route. I wonder if there's something open source. So, there is... What is it? Mapbox has something specific throughout optimization. And I started playing with it last year, but at the time, like, there was no, maybe the year before, but, like, you know, so you couldn't really, there was no MCP stuff yet. I didn't, I haven't tried since, but I'm pretty sure now we were to, like, basically just hand that API over to, like, bought or something until, like, have to figure out how, like, build a route optimization for this use case. I can't imagine it could be that hard to do. Because that API, though, was pretty clean. Like, I remember playing it to the extent of, like, I could actually send it information, it returned, like, Siri. Here's why. Um... That's another piece that I think could be interesting and, like, kind of put at the door, like, cut out all the hours you're spending about optimizers. Um, but again, I don't, I'm assuming that's what every transportation business is dealing with the stomach, but it depends on the model. So, like, these guys probably wouldn't carry. So they're like, you know, like, we're growing up and down, this is there. Yes. Um, somebody, like, a shuttle service in Phoenix would definitely care, 'cause he wouldn't tell you something. Um... But, again, that's assuming they have this problem and that's the problem. They want to solve or that's their higher priority. Yeah. I'm getting out of myself. I don't think so. Because the part we have to think about. I think, as we build the requirements for this, I can understand additional market research to understand, if even outside of Hudson. What are these folks using? The payment is quick, and then my dad has a process, like, gas cards was a big thing for him. Oh, I remember that. I mean, would you just, like, fucking having to refill his gas cards and track what employee did what? And whether or not they were leveraging gas cards for actual driving versus the one to pick up cocaine. It was such, it was the ban of his existence, and he was, like, felt technically responsible because he was paying for the cards. Like maybe is there software for that? I don't know. I think that's like aspects of that. model of understanding what, like, the day the day creations are. I know you do. potentially pull some information. Maybe it's just no bookeller on television. Yeah, okay. All right. So in terms of takeaways, if we start sprinting, certain, why not wondering? Down, bro. I'm unemployed, bro. It was fucking get it. Just sprint one on Monday. We're focus on transportation business. Mm hmm. And that's gonna be our first target. Yeah. Between then and now, I'm going to start the building out what our process looks like. Key tenants of what the thing is, what we're going to call ourselves. Maybe it's Rita or not. I'm gonna send it to you in the next couple of days. At least we get that approved, so by the time we get to the sprint, we know what we're doing. And I think we'll probably have to click down to like, I think if we're gonna move in the speed that we're suggesting, we need to make sure that we're not doing the same thing at the same time. Yeah. So that's something for us to figure out and think about. And I think that'll just, the working relationship and understanding like how we go build off each other and communicate. I think become crisp as we do a couple of these, right? That's gonna have to work the kinks out, you know? That's my thought. I just want to make sure that I don't end up, like, getting myself stuck in the hole, where, like, all of a sudden, I'm just gonna go in circles, and you're gonna be like, Bro, what the fuck? I'm not shipping anything. So, absolutely be, like, if you ever find that I'm, like, delayed or anything, be like, where the fuck is this? Like, I don't have cars deal. Okay, yeah. Keep that in mind. How do we stay full stand-ups? Definitely. Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't see any reason why we shouldn't, like, just use what we know how to do from, you know, simple wing. You have working in our professional lives. Yeah. Um... I'm trying to think in terms of, like, what else? I want to say I have a list of transportation software that I made several years ago. It's probably... No, but I'll see if I can dig that up, 'cause that might give us some food. I mean, if not, it's not gonna be that hard for me to just have to tattoo a tea. Sure. Um, But on my end, I also dig around and see what I already have, because I actually spend like a decent amount of time thinking through this several years ago, and like, I have a bike and go to somewhere. Um, so, I'll see if I can find those. But I guess, going into sprint one, we're focusing on transportation. Do we want to pick a specific vertical or then transfer good? Just kind of rock for now. Let's say, let's let me take the action... of doing a certain initial research to understand. If it is, let's say right now, we know of 33 circles in a Venn diagram. NAMC, which is dying, with every indication that I know, it's not going well. Fixed route, pickup and drop off, and transportation. individual pick up that, and I think that has the most meat to it in terms of like software route from communization, but definitely more complicated. Yeah, it's definitely more complicated. There's a lot of that to shit trip us up. It's for us to be aware of the words all in that. That said, I think, regardless of what direction is going, we get our foot in the door, so... Yeah. You know, it'll be a good preface. Well, iterate. But even finding, like, again, I'm just guardrails, just focus on Arizona. Like... What is the scope of potential clientele in each of 3 areas? Who's making the most money? Who's using the oldest software? Like, is there a way that we can even just like hang out? And understanding of what that is before Monday. That's something we could collaborate on. To make a colleague up to this friend, okay, we're doing transportation, because right now I ask him, like, which vertical are we focusing on? I don't know. Because I haven't sat down and really like thought through it. I would hate for us to pick a direction and the 1st sprint then actually turns out to be fucking tiny. No one actually wins, you know? Which, by the way, why do you think that any EMT stuff is dying? It's interesting. That's beautiful. Uh, the insurance premiums have gone 50% in the last year. just to maintain, um, aid, contracting access. Wow. And they are signing, and each of the tribes are starting their own medical transportation system. If we look at the list, they're like, Pass Wild, Yabba Pyre, has their own transportation, and since they like having Native American drivers pick up and drop off other Native Americans, they're just hiring their own peoples to do the drives. So, since it's becoming so expensive, and access is just denying claims for no fucking reason. Like my dad has to resubmit a claim from 3 months ago and 5 times, mostly when they like 7. So the actual payments are coming delayed when you can't pay the drivers on time. I mean, you're not getting any trips. there's like all these little small things like, like, right now in Tucson, if you look at the list, there's only 10 EMT businesses that are remaining with Tucson phone numbers. I don't know if that means they're not doing business in Tucson. But if you compare the list a year or 2 years ago, they were 20, 25, 30, or something, a lot of them are just dropping out. Like a lot of my dad's friends are just out of work. Like, in the WhatsApp group chat, asking for money type shit. Same. So I don't know if it's generally dying, but... The fact that it's government regulated for a lot of, at least access, VNN. Uh, it's just a, it's a slippery, a slippier slope for businesses to stay operation, which I wish I had known before I fucking started cleaning up. Because everyone's just like, bro, I'm barely making lines, you know, I'm going to pay for something. I mean, what's your dad gonna do? Huh? He's gonna retire. Yeah, I was done. I think there's something interesting there, though. I mean, not any of he's talking, just medical transportation. There's actually something I was trying to get my dad into. Because, like, at the time, like, the shuttle was kind of slow, like, it was not all, whatever it was. Um, but there were, I mean, I don't, you probably know her better than I, but, like, there's different types of medical transportation, right? Seems like medical carriers picking it heavy right now. Having, uh, the facilities to pick up and store medications, take them to hospitals, take them to clients, making sure that they say at a particular temperature, uh, Even on a contract basis. I'm seeing a lot of TikToks about people going over the fan masters. Well, with that, you mean it... Oh, certainly, like, you know, you have to have nice variant and shit like that. So for themselves, being as well to consider that. All right. So maybe, maybe, maybe we actually hope it was like spend some time doing the research on this. You see blocks? Because, I mean, for mine, I definitely need to be proud of that at the speed of, like, what do you even exist sitting on? Let's split it. Let's divide and come. I'll do any MT because I've been working in that world. Unsuccessfully, a sort of life student. You want to... take on... I probably start out, like, just kind of, I mean, obviously, I'm going to be using AIs teams. I mean, but, like, just give me an understanding or, like, broadly, like, what are the types of, like, chef stationaries that exist? Like, kind of, like, see where the different commercial parts in there. Because I'm sure there's probably certain types that exist more up in Tucson or in Arizona more than... That's a good point. We could start there with that. But the medical one, too, I don't remember what type of medical physical food there. Is a community called um, Fail, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They hit up my dad to do Zystorms. Yeah, like, when broke, basically. It looks like Uber, sure, I was playing. Non-emergency medical transportation where they're determining the, the, the person who needs to be taken to the pharmacy, uh, says they need to be picked up on top of that time. Vail takes a cut and they'll say, hey, company, here's an email. This is my name when you get picked up. This is how much we'll give you. Interesting. That was a couple. Yeah. Like, I remember looking into Bayo as, like, something that my dad's coming to, I've been there for, like, getting involved in, like, 100 grand, I'm feeling advice. Um, that type of, probably, maybe like lower, lower risk medical transportation businesses, might be able to put me in the area, just like, whatever it is. And whatever it is that we find out, we'll see. Yeah. And then, I guess, just bringing out our name, slapping together our landing page, and I definitely still think that we should, like, reach out to, like, the... Argue whatever organization we can, or not, they sound of, like, small business service edition, their level businesses. And just like seeing what kind of flights we get there. That said, like, kind of culmination of all our conversation is like the quality of the clientele is definitely, I think, is something we maybe initially we can't be too picky, but I definitely think we should be picking up that it's actually working our time. Is it worth working with, like, a tiny coffee shop at this point in time? Maybe fun. But I don't know if they're gonna, like, pay us enough to make it perfect. Okay. But it might be just be good to get that experience. Yeah, especially, absolutely. What do you want? Do you have any... re thread? I'm cool with that. Honestly, I threw it out there just because, like, it was there. I'm not I'm not attached here at home. Like, I'm more than happy to just keep that as, like, some little block posting that I had from back up, because that's all I was gonna do initially by them, right? Just start, like, writing posts of, like, the stuff I was building and be like, here it is, if you want it, you know, take it, it's open source. Small business, hopefully, this helps you out with taking control of your shit. Yeah, I'll send you a cut. I'm cool with that being it for now, and I, uh, do other potential names that might be... Because maybe that's something I already was playing. I don't know if there was an existing company in Tucson or... an acting company or whatever, that doesn't happen to go. I haven't even checked, actually, so I... I'll find that. Yeah, okay, cool. So, Brandon, operational process, we have Sprint one. Uh, we know that we both need to simultaneously do market research on Spotify, right? What else? Based on, I mean, based on our research, we'll have a better sense of the companies that we should reach out to for that. Um, we should, I'm guessing, probably have some sense of, like, where we're talking, like, size, some of the problems of these companies they're probably dealing with. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we know them well enough. Like, I guess we know to some extent in the transportation industry, we know the generally problems of it. So probably also just, like, using that as our starting, what? Like, for example, for that, company in Phoenix, aside from outdated software, it's like, they're spending way too much time just routing on terms of routing and not automization. not. spending a hell of time just trying to dispatch stuff because after time from what I remember. something's changed, it's like, um, the way that, that, for example, somebody lands in Phoenix, and the way that they actually have to, like, get the ride is they have to call the office and say, hey, I landed. Where do I meet you guys? But to do that, I'm not using service. Um, I mean, so you can imagine there's, like, so many different opportunities to basically be like, this is costing you to this. Yeah. Um... Yeah, so I guess just thinking about, like, some of the challenges and not, and then from there, I guess, within the sprint itself, like, we could probably, you know, the sizing of the problems that we want to say and we know the top. T-shirts on this. Adam. And then on Monday, not a spread couple, maybe decide of those problems with Tic Tac. And then, probably, like, what, what, local companies, they would say, to contact, to check. And then I'll talk to my brother. I'll talk to my cousin. I'll talk to my dad about the trouble here, see if he still knows anybody. I talked to my dad, too. I'm gonna let him tasting it, see, what he did the contact. Because I think there's a lot of folks in the program last time. I'm crazy. And I'm taking mental note of this stuff, so I can put it into playing, too. Just so you know, it's not, like... I mean, this is, like, we're basically, like, this is our startup, so this is absolutely going to be messy than it's supposed to be. Yeah. But I'm excited, Ron. have fun with it, too. I think that's probably a big mistake. I made like a really run. Just like, I was so... I came out of, like, this bone, like, execution. I forgot, like, you know, this isn't time to stick around, but... But I'm like, it feels better to know that kind of thing. We both, although we're gonna dig around, I think we're on the same page about how we go about it. Because it's harder to do alone. I can imagine. Yeah, you tell me, I'd be, you're hacking at it for a while. It is definitely an interesting challenge. We went out a lot. Yeah. It's like, fuck, man, there's nobody to tell me I'm going crazy here. Yeah, yeah. At least in somebody else. I mean, you can tell why I do that. fucking stupid. Just fucking stop. Yeah. My head's going on. Last ten, you could call. I wonder if there's a way to... I was just, 'cause we were talking, you thinking about the gas card thing? I wonder if there was, like, a way we could, like, an Apple Pay type system, API, that... is, basically, a brokerage service to send money in real time past trips come available. So you only have utterly just enough gas to get the day to do the drives that you're been selected to complete. Huh. I don't know enough about gas cards to, like, give a common, but I definitely think that's an interesting album made to it. I'm sure, I mean, I know for a fact my dad used to do a lot with, like, drivers just buying themselves gas. Like, what the fuck? Like, my dad goes, like, he has... He'll go to, like, quick trip, or kind of straight, and then he still parts of just that you'll only work with. Like, look at the gas room, you can buy some of that pedal. Yeah, I wonder if they can wait to, like, track, audit the line and have the spending of the college. And then... We're getting into, like, the IOC thing, so think it's getting too cold. Just let me see... I mean, who knows what happens when we get there, which, by the way, it's not even that we have to build everything, right? Like, it may actually literally be like, we're just gonna take it off the shelf solution, because we think it's better than what you have, and here's why. Like, we're not gonna build it for you. here, again. This is what works best for you. No, like, for the pharmacy thing, my homemown comment, they literally just wrapped the existing AI, phone goal theater. symptoms is all, such a little fox, it's... He better do that. Charge some about the subscription. I'm like, I don't know any better, so it's all out. She's good, yeah. So he's just paid, just making money on top of the subscription was paid. Which, by the way, I mean, it's like, it's his service. I mean, is he managing it every month? I can put it at last. Yeah, he's working with an engineer that's still on code. Who doesn't know how to code them? It's also pissing. It pissed me off, but like he doesn't, all he is is just like talking to me. He's good at it. I'm gonna lie, like, I'm happy for this. You think it'd be worth it for us to have a conversation with them at one point of, like, they were starting their own gig here in Arizona? Like, do us anything nice? Or do you see it as competition? Um, I've talked to him at nauseum about it, honestly, I think he just has an existing, he's really good at, He just knows. Dude, this guy's lived in Seattle. as long as I have, and he's introduced me to maybe 50 Muslims of my college. He just knows what he did. I think that's his secret, is, like, he just knows it. We can talk to him, but I don't have the energy or the personality to do anything. Right over here. And I don't know if that's a play. He's just one of those guys that just like... You know about a network? Yeah, he's a networker. Yeah, that's not me. Yeah, it's not me. I'm sorry. It can be. Maybe it can. Maybe that's what he stretch or something. Yeah, it's... I'm better at, like, having, like, building, like, you know, small number of sprawl size and shapes. That's my, I'm really seeing boats, fortunately, it's unfortunate. But yeah, we can talk to him. I mean, only if you think it's worth it. It's really with other people who come back from advancement. Yeah, sure. But again, move it out. I'm the... Yeah, bro. I'm really safe. excited, man. Yeah, me too. That'd be fun. I think what's joke about this time around is, like... We've had our expansional traditional experience over the last few years, and learned a lot. Did a lot of special share? Yeah. They school a lot of under. I've lost me both, both have. Yeah. Now we know, at the time. I definitely burned a lot of cash out stupidly. Have, uh, what, like eight outfits? Um, I just swap that out with, like, a pineapple one. Oh, excuse me. All right. All right. I'll be back, Tony, before I go, though. Yeah, I'll be around. All right. See you later, baby.
