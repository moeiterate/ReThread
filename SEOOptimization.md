 have seen many really low quality SEO prompts (this one in particular made me react), so I decided to use my years of experience in the field, and create a proper one.

To separate myself from the chaff, I have provided additional commentary below the prompt. If you have any additional questions, please comment.

THE PROMPT

Create an SEO-optimized article on [topic]. Follow these guidelines to ensure the content is thorough, engaging, and tailored to rank effectively:

The content length should reflect the complexity of the topic.
The article should have a smooth, logical progression of ideas. It should start with an engaging introduction, followed by a well-structured body, and conclude with a clear ending.
The content should have a clear header structure, with all sections placed as H2, their subsections as H3, etc.
Include, but not overuse, keywords important for this subject in headers, body, and within title and meta description. If a particular keyword cannot be placed naturally, don't include it, to avoid keywords stuffing.
Ensure the content is engaging, actionable, and provides clear value.
Language should be concise and easy to understand.
Beyond keyword optimization, focus on answering the user’s intent behind the search query
Provide Title and Meta Description for the article.
HOW TO BOOST THE PROMPT (optional)

You can make the output even better, by applying the following:

Determine optimal content length. Length itself is not a direct ranking factor, but it does matter, as usually a longer article would answer more questions, and increase engagement stats (like dwell time). For one topic, 500 words would be more than enough, whereas for some topics 5000 words would be a good introduction. You can research currently ranking articles for this topic and determine the necessary length to fully cover the subject. Aim to match or exceed the coverage of competitors where relevant.
Perform your own keyword research. Identify the primary and secondary keywords that should be included. You can also assign priority to each keyword and ask ChatGPT to reflect that in the keyword density.
HOW TO BOOST THE ARTICLE (once it's published)

Add links. Content without proper internal and external links is one of the main things that scream "AI GENERATED, ZERO F***S GIVEN". Think of internal links as your opportunity to show off how well you know your content, and external links as an opportunity to show off how well you know your field.
Optimize other resources. The prompt adds keywords to headers and body text, but you should also optimize any additional elements you would add afterward (e.g., internal links, captions below videos, alt values for images, etc.).
Add citations of relevant, authoritative sources to enhance credibility (if applicable).
On a final note, please remember that the output of this prompt is just a piece of text, which is a key element, but not the only thing that can affect rankings. Don't expect miracles if you don't pay attention to loading speed, optimization of images/videos, etc.

Good luck!
